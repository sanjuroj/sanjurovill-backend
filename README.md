## Full backend for the Sanjuroville website

I had originally thought about making each app a separate repository so others could more easily deploy the apps on their own systems.  I decided it's a bit premature for that and that just having everything in one backend avoids lots of headaches.  Eventually if/when the apps are more mature, I can think about making them standalone, installable, modules.
